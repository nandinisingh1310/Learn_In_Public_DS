# Learn_In_Public_DS
This project applies Masked R-CNN for instance segmentation on a Blood Cell dataset. It detects and segments blood cells in images, producing bounding boxes, masks, and class labels for each detected cell.

📌 Features
✔ Implements Masked R-CNN for object detection & segmentation
✔ Uses a pretrained COCO model for feature extraction
✔ Processes images from a Blood Cell dataset
✔ Visualizes segmented cells with masks & bounding boxes
📂 Dataset
Place your blood cell images in a directory (update dataset_path in the script).

Ensure images are in .jpg format.

🖼 Sample Output

🏗 Future Improvements
Fine-tune the Masked R-CNN model for higher accuracy

Train on a custom blood cell dataset

Deploy as a web-based application
